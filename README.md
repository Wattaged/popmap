# popmap

A tiddlywiki popup editor.

Popmap aims to make it easy to overlay an internal image tiddler with marker 'pins' that generate popups.

This is a 'beta' work in progress and will change as it develops. Don't use it for anything important, backup your wikis. Use at your own risk. There is no javascript used, all necessary tiddlers are in the sidebar.
Feedback and corrections welcome.
